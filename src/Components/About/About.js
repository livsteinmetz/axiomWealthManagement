					<h3>Axiom</h3>
					<h4>an established rule, principle or self-evident truth</h4>
					<h4>a principle or foundation upon which all else is built</h4>
					<p>
						At Axiom Wealth Management, it’s not just business, it’s personal.
						Solid personal relationships and sound financial practices are the
						pillars upon which successful relationships are built and goals are
						achieved. My average relationship exceeds 19 years and, for more
						than half my client base, includes two or more generations of their
						families. I help make financial goals clear and attainable, families
						financially secure and dreams a reality. My axioms are:
					</p>
					<ul id="AxiomList">
						<li>Honesty and integrity are simply unquestionable.</li>
						<li>As a fiduciary, always act in the clients' best interest.</li>
						<li>
							Know the client; clearly understand current and evolving needs.
						</li>
					</ul>
